# ensemblemerge
ensemblemerge is a package that implements a common work flow for several single cell RNA sequence integration methods including Seurat V3, Scanorama, Harmony, Liger, fastMNN, and bbknn. The merging process is designed to be as streamlined as possible for the user, only requiring a **SummarizedExperiment**, **SingleCellExperiment**, or **Seurat** object and a specification of which method should be used to integrate in `setParams()`.

**Instructions, documentation, and examples can be found online at: [EnsembleMerge](https://erikjskie.github.io/packages/ensemblemerge/)**

**Docker images of pre-built package environments are found online at: [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/skiex003/ensemblemerge)**

**An example vignette can be found here: [preview ](https://github.com/erikjskie/ensemblemerge/blob/main/EnsembleMerge_Example_Vignette.ipynb)|[ colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/erikjskie/ensemblemerge/blob/main/EnsembleMerge_Example_Vignette.ipynb)**

## Prerequisites
The following R packages are required for installation of ensemblemerge:

```r
devtools::install_github('satijalab/seurat-wrappers')
```

The following packages are necessary only if using the following Merge methods:
  Python Packages
  ```r
  system("pip install pynndescent") #optimizes dimension reduction
  system("pip install leidenalg") #optional clustering algorithm that improves bbknn performance
  ```
  
preconfigured environments are available here:
| Configuration | OS | R Version | 
| --- | --- | --- |
| [base](Linux_4_0_4_environment.yml) | Linux (Ubuntu 18.04) | 4.0.4 |
| [full methods](environment.yml) | Linux (Ubuntu 18.04) | 4.1.1 |

  
## Quick start guide

Once ensemblemerge is currently under reveiw for cran submission, currently ensemblemerge can be installed by:

```r
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install("devtools")
devtools::install_github("erikjskie/ensemblemerge")
```

Once ensemblemerge is installed, merging batches can be performed by the following:

```r
library(ensemblemerge)

#merge with single method
pbmc #small 500 cell by 500 feature, 2 batch dataset

params = setParams(method = "Seurat"), return = "Seurat") #different integration methods can be selected by setting method, see methods by calling getMethods()

merged_data = Merge(params, pbmc)

ensemblemerged_data = EnsembleMerge(pbmc, methods = c("Seurat", "Harmony", "BBKNN"), return = "Seurat")
```
